# CSS 2A Final Project   

## Overview   
This is our final project for CSS 2A where we are to create a text based game.

## Our Proposal      
Our project will be based on the game Wheel of Fortune allowing multiple players to play together and try to guess phrase with a given category and set amount of letters.  

## Functionality     
Players will see a blank message/phrase with a certain amount of letters and what category it relates to. The first player will spin the wheel and be given the chance to guess what letter could be a part of that message.       
a)  if the player guesses a correct letter, they will earn points based on how many times the letter has shown up in the message.     
    player can choose guess the message/phrase or spin again    
b)  if the player guesses incorrectly their turn ends and the next player will have the opportunity to spin the wheel and guess a letter    
c)  game keeps going until a player guesses the correct message/phrase and that ends the round
